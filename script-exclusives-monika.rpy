    m 1g "… That’s a good point." 
    m 2b "The truth is though, I would only \"earn\" my presidency over the other clubs because I’m popular." 
    m 2j "I’d rather ACTUALLY earn it, for a start."
    m 2e "Plus, I still like it quieter anyway. That’s part of the reason it’s a literature club, as not many people will willingly join this."
    "A fair point, seeing as how Sayori had to almost drag me there." 
    mc "I can't understand this though."

    mc "Why would you NOT want that kind of thing?" 
    m 4e "For one, being watched like that is terrible." 
    m 5a "Have you ever watched the TV show \"Bigger Brother\"?" 
    m "The one with cameras, always and constantly watching?"
    m "Imagine that, every day at school." 
    m "If I was talking to you like this just a few hours earlier, there would already be hundreds of rumors about how you and I are making out in a closet together."
    "I try to hide how much that idea makes me blush." 
    "She continues."
    m 5b "I’m more puzzled at why you'd WANT that?"
